sql中常用五大聚合函数: max()、min()、sum()、avg()、count()

两种用途
查询的结果为一行一列
与group by分组结合

求每门课程的平均分
```sql
select course_name, avg(score) as avg from course 
    group by course_name;
```

每门课程的选课人数
```sql
select course_name, count(*) as selected_num from course 
    group by course_name;
```

每门课程的男生及格人数
```sql
select course_name, count(*) as passed_num from course 
    where score > 60 
        group by course_name 
            having gender='male';
```

每门课程的男生及格人数，并按照及格人数从高到低排序
```sql
select course_name, count(*) as passed_num from course 
    where score > 60 
        group by course_name 
            having gender='male'
                order by count(*) desc;
```
